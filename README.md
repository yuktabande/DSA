# 🧠 Practice Arena – Python & C++

Welcome to my personal code playground! This repository is where I upload my **Python** and **C++** practice questions and solutions as I work to improve my problem-solving skills and stay consistent with daily coding.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Sharpen problem-solving and logic-building abilities  
- Maintain a **consistent** coding habit  
- Track progress in Python and C++ through hands-on exercises  
- Prepare for coding interviews, competitive programming, and academic practice

## 📌 What to Expect

- ✍️ **Raw solutions** – sometimes messy, always honest  
- 📅 Organized (or soon-to-be) by day/topic  
- 🧪 Mix of easy, medium, and hard problems  
- 📈 Progress over perfection – this is all about staying consistent!
